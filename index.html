                     Wendy is so dope. Called and made an appointment to put a down payment before I walked in. She definitely took care of me with the haircut and line up. Who would've thought of the hot towel and mask to make sure your face stand out after walking out a new person with a new look. Thank you for hooking me up. If I'm near the area best believe I'll be back soon.
